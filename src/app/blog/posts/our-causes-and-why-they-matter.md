# Our Causes, And Why They Matter

## It’s an exciting time here at now-u.

With the introduction of new causes and the launch of our new app on the horizon, it’s never been a better time to help us make meaningful change. Just a few clicks is all it takes to support causes you care about, here in the UK and all around the world. 

So what are our new causes, and why do they matter?

**1. Health and Wellbeing**

Health and wellbeing affects our happiness and plays a big part when it comes to achieving our potential. It’s a core need, and yet millions of people around the world are denied access to basic healthcare.

Our recent health and wellbeing campaigns have covered everything from protecting our mental health in the wake of Covid-19 to improving access to menstrual health products and education across the globe. 


**2. Equality & human rights**

Recent events in Afghanistan have highlighted the fragility of human rights and equalities. In fact, the UN has already received reports of serious human rights violations in the country, fearing that certain communities will be dangerously at risk, especially women, children and members of the LGBTQ+ community.
 
Whilst much has been achieved in some countries in terms of offering an inclusive, respectful society for all of us to live in, recent events show us just how far we still need to go. 
 
We’ve campaigned for LGBTQ+ rights, media freedom and disability rights and will continue to fight for the right for everyone to exercise their rights in our upcoming campaigns.


**3. Environment**
 
We’re more aware than ever of our devastating impact on the planet and its resources. The World Economic Forum explains that we must take action now if we’re to prevent irreversible changes to our climate, planet and way of life. 
 
Now-u’s environmental campaigns have seen us promote sustainable eating habits and green recovery here in the UK, as well as support marine wildlife conservation around the world. 
 
Take action in our upcoming environmental campaigns to help us protect our world for generations to come.

**4. Economic opportunity** 
 
Across the globe, citizens are routinely denied opportunities to learn, advance and succeed. Many countries around the world experience myriad issues with access to employment and poverty, with the pandemic driving an extra 97 million people into extreme poverty. 
 
Despite the UK being one of the richest countries in the world, we have a ‘very high’ level of income inequality in comparison to countries with a similar GDP. In fact, 11.7 million people in the UK live in relative poverty and the richest 10% of households in the UK have 44% of its total wealth. 
 
Providing opportunities for everyone to advance economically makes for a fairer, happier and more productive society.
 
 
**5. Education & citizenship** 
 
According to UNESCO, 263 million children who should be in school, are not. That number is equivalent to a quarter of the whole population of Europe, with girls still being more likely than their male peers to never receive an education. 
 
A lack of education feeds into economic inequalities, poorer health outcomes and, ultimately, a low quality of life. It must be tackled, if we’re to provide an inclusive society for all. 
 
 
**6. Safe & inclusive communities**

Our homes and communities should be our safe places. But for some, they’re anything but. In fact, the Counting Dead Women Project states that 14 women and 2 children were killed by perpetrators of domestic abuse in the first three weeks of lockdown alone. 

Systemic racism remains a widespread and incredibly serious issue. Barnardo’s explains how BAME children are affected - they’re disciplined more at school, face higher levels of poverty and are more likely to be arrested. 

Access for those with disabilities in our communities needs urgent improvement. Campaigners have taken to social media to highlight access problems in the UK, including 25-year-old wheelchair user Katie Pennick, who struggled to fit through gaps between outdoor diners in London earlier this year.

Get involved in our upcoming safe and inclusive communities campaigns to make change, together.


The launch of the brand new version of the NOW-U app is just around the corner, featuring campaigns covering each of our causes, along with exciting new features. We’re focusing on engaging long-term with our users, as well as showcasing the vital work carried out by our partner organisations.
